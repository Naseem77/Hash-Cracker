# 1- Brute-force attack
In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of  eventually guessing correctly.

# 2- Dictionary attack
In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is a form of brute force attack technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying thousands or millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary or previously used passwords, often from lists obtained from past security breaches.

Hash cracker supports dictionary attacks for hash types md5, sha1.

# How to Use:
