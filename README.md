# Hash-Cracker

# 1- Brute-force attack
In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of  eventually guessing correctly.

# 2- Dictionary attack
In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is a form of brute force attack technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying thousands or millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary or previously used passwords, often from lists obtained from past security breaches.

# Hash cracker supports dictionary attacks for hash types md5, sha1.

# How to Use:

Hashcracker will ask you to enter a hash, It will automatically detect what type of hash is entered (Must be one of the selected hash which is MD5 or SHA1).

Hashcracker will then prompt you to enter the name of the wordlist you would like to use. Must be in the wordlist.txt, otherwise program will give this message "please make sure to include the full path to the wordlist".
